As a typical Computer Science student in the School of Engineering and Digital Sciences (SEDS) at Nazarbayev University, I've frequently heard a stereotype about our students in the School of Sciences and Humanities (SSH). It's often joked that SSH students spend their academic life in the Daily Cup by writing essays with an iced latte in hand, while engineers spend sleepless nights “chaling” (studying)  physics. Additionally, when my friends fail their engineering exams, they always jokingly say, “That’s the end, I’m transferring to a world languages and literature major!”[1]. They act as if switching to social sciences will make their life easier. But in reality, social sciences are not as easy as people may think, especially writing essays. [1] Today, I want to break those stereotypes by giving examples from my own struggles with academic writing, even though I am that SEDS student.
Going back to 2011, I was the type of child who neither wanted to go to kindergarten nor wanted to stay at home. I was always in between, searching for something interesting. For that reason, my parents decided to enroll me in school when I was just five years old. My school was a regular one, not NIS, BIL, or NSPM, in a little village near Almaty called “Zharkent”. I clearly remember my first day of school: it was announced that we will be learning Russian. The Russian language, for a 5-year-old who only spoke Kazakh, was a completely new and difficult challenge [2]. However, by staying steadfast and spending countless hours on individual lessons, I became fluent in the language by the third grade. [1] Just as I was getting comfortable with Russian, another linguistic challenge was on the horizon — English.
